# MyVector C++ Template Class

The `MyVector` class is a C++ template implementation of a dynamic array (vector) that automatically resizes itself when needed. It provides methods for inserting, removing, and sorting elements, as well as accessing elements using indexing. The class is designed to mimic some of the behavior of the `std::vector` class in the C++ Standard Library, offering dynamic memory allocation and resizing to store a collection of elements of any type.

## Features

- Automatic resizing: The `MyVector` class dynamically increases its capacity when more elements are added.
- Insertion and Removal: Easily insert elements at the end and remove the last element.
- Indexing: Access elements using the `[]` operator with bounds checking.
- Sorted Insertion: Insert elements while maintaining sorted order.
- Insertion Sort: Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort elements.
- Display: Print the elements in the vector to the console.

## Usage

1. Include the `MyVector.h` header file in your C++ project.
2. Use the provided constructors and methods to manage and manipulate your vector.
3. Remember to include both `MyVector.h` and `MyVector.cpp` files in your project.
